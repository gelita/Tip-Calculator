Tip Calculator for Android 
=============

This is an Android Tip Calculator application for calculating a tip for service. 
Time spent: 5-8 hours spent in total.  I completed the basic requirements and then made changes and then reversed some changes. 

Completed user stories:

Required: 

User is displayed the tip of specified percentage for specified entered amount.
User enters the total amount of the transaction and is prompted to do so with focus set to the editText text field.
User can select between tip amounts (i.e 10%, 15%, 20%) in the form of radio buttons.
Upon selecting tip amount, formatted tip value and grand total (bill + tip amount) is displayed automatically.  

Optional:
User changes the total amount and updated tip is reflected automatically.
User can select custom tip percentage if desired by sliding the seekBar.  
The changes in tip amount and bill are updated automatically.
Improved the user interface and experience by using a green dollar sign image.
